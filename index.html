        </div>

        <p> Jesus is the firstborn and only son of God our savior.
            He died on the cross for our sins to save the world from eternal death.
            Jesus is great at showing us how a human being should live. 
            In the bible we can see many stories about it and how he served as an example to humanity.
            Based on the bible there is only one God, though Jesus is not God, he is a part of him like a daughter is to their mother. He is of his spirit but as a human with emotions, troubles, and temptations.

        <h3 style="text-align: center; font-family:'Arial;'">Why is the scripture important?</h3>
        <p>

            The scripture is very important, not only because it has the story of Jesus in it,
            but also because the stories in the bible serve as examples on how we should live our life and shows us the consecuences if we choose to live a sinful life. 
            Though a lot of people think that the rules in the bible mean God is being "controlling" the truth is that it is for our own good.
 
            The bible is like guidebook, a roadmap to help us get through life. 
            <br>
          <pre></pre>

            There are many verses and reasons in the bible that remind us why the bible is important.
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Foundation of our faith</b></li>

                    Because faith is believing in something that you can not see but you can feel.
                    In Romans 10:17 it explains that faith comes from hearing the message and the only way the message can be heard is through the word about Christ. 
                    <pre></pre>

                    <li><b>Wisdom</b></li>
                    We can not have wisdom without God helping us build it.
                    In James 1:5 it states that if one lacks wisdom to ask God for it and he will give it to you.
                    God isn't just going to hand you wisdom, he will test you and allow you to grow into it over time                     <pre></pre>

                    These are just a few examples of verses that provide insight into the Bible's message.
                    There are many more throughout Scripture that deepen our understanding.                    <!-- something here -->
